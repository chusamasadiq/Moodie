## Retrospective Increment #0

### Initial Board:

We had slow progress throughout this iteration, mainly due to:
- Learning the necessary technologies to be able to start, leading to a hefty learning curve
- Starting work for this iteration later than we hoped for

For our next iterations, we plan to start sooner, and predict we will have some difficulties as only a couple of our members were able to learn and apply the new technologies so far.

As positives, we point out the UI mockups we managed to create and the style we decided on for our app, and managing to deliver everything in spite of the learning difficulties.

This iteration was more efficient, although we still suffered from slow paced progress:
- Work division should be more organized and even, some of us took on work that depended on other teamates' progress, and that halted progress until a later time
- We are still learning the ins and out of the new technologies

For our next iterations, we hope to have our release done sooner, and adjust our work pace, as some people finished their tasks pretty quickly.

As positives, we furthered our knowledge, althought not the whole team is well versed in all required technologies yet, and we managed to work together to complete a solid feature.
